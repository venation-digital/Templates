## 2. Threat actor baseball cards

There's much to be said on the level of detail you need to capture in your own threat intelligence repository. I've added a good-enough template to this repo to serve as a basis for your program. Bare in mind that this is dependent on the audience as well! Sometimes you just report on: 

Threat actor(s), Category	(e.g. Organized cybercrime group), Capability	(e.g. Medium; <explanation>) and Intent	(e.g. Low; explanation>).
